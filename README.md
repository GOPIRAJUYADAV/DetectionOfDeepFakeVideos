# DetectionOfDeepFakeVideos
The aim of this project is to develop a novel approach for detecting deepfake videos by leveraging long-distance attention mechanisms within neural networks. Deepfakes are manipulated videos that use artificial intelligence to create realistic but fake content, posing significant risks for misinformation and fraud.
